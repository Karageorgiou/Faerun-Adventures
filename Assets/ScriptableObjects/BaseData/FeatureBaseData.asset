  features:
  - featureTitle: Criminal Contact
    featureDescription: You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your
      liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and
      from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local
      messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages
      for you.
  - featureTitle: Criminal Specialty
    featureDescription: There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves'
      guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular
      specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have
      strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role
      you played in your criminal life.
  - featureTitle: Darkvision
    featureDescription: You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
      can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
      in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only
      shades of gray.
  - featureTitle: Dwarven Combat Training
    featureDescription: You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer,
      and warhammer.
  - featureTitle: Dwarven Resilience
    featureDescription: You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you
      have resistance against poison damage.
  - featureTitle: FalseIdentity
    featureDescription: You have created a second identity that includes documentation,
      established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona.
      Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal
      letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the
      handwriting you are trying to copy.
  - featureTitle: Favorite Schemes
    featureDescription: Every charlatan has an angle they use in preference to other
      schemes. Choose a favorite scam.
  - featureTitle: Fey Ancestry
    featureDescription: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed,
      and magic can't put you to sleep.
  - featureTitle: Keen Senses
    featureDescription: You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
  - featureTitle: Military Rank
    featureDescription: You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers
      loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and
      influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke
      your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment
      or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military
      encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.
  - featureTitle: Shelter Of The Faithfull
    featureDescription: As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share
      your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You
      and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care
      at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you
      must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your
      religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.  You might
      also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon,
      and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to
      serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found
      a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance,
      provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good
      standing with your temple.
  - featureTitle: Specialty
    featureDescription: During your time as a soldier, you had a specific role to
      play in your unit or army.
  - featureTitle: Stonecutting
    featureDescription: Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related
      to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill
      and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal
      proficiency bonus.
  - featureTitle: Trance
    featureDescription: Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining
      semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance."
      While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental
      exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting
      in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
  - featureTitle: Watchers Eye
    featureDescription: Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers,
      gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local
      outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out
      the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to
      be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.
