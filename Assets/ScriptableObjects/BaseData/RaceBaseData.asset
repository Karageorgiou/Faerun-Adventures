    - featureTitle: Darkvision
      featureDescription: You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
        can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
        in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness,
        only shades of gray.
    - featureTitle: Fey Ancestry
      featureDescription: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed,
        and magic can't put you to sleep.
    - featureTitle: Keen Senses
      featureDescription: You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
    - featureTitle: Trance
      featureDescription: Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining
        semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is
        "trance." While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually
        mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After
        resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours
        of sleep.
