    features:
    - featureTitle: Shelter of the Faithful
      featureDescription: As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share
        your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You
        and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care
        at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though
        you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share
        your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.  You
        might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity
        or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where
        you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where
        you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the
        priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous
        and you remain in good standing with your temple.

    - featureTitle: Favorite Schemes
      featureDescription: Every charlatan has an angle they use in preference to
        other schemes. Choose a favorite scam.
    - featureTitle: False Identity
      featureDescription: You have created a second identity that includes documentation,
        established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona.
        Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal
        letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the
        handwriting you are trying to copy.

    - featureTitle: Watcher's Eye
      featureDescription: Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with
        lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily
        find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as
        easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're
        more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.

    - featureTitle: Criminal Specialty
      featureDescription: There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves'
        guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular
        specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have
        strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role
        you played in your criminal life.
    - featureTitle: Criminal Contact
      featureDescription: You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as
        your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages
        to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know
        the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can
        deliver messages for you.

    - featureTitle: Specialty
      featureDescription: During your time as a soldier, you had a specific role
        to play in your unit or army.
    - featureTitle: Military Rank
      featureDescription: You have a military rank from your career as a soldier.
        Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your
        authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank.
        You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition
        simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access
        to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.
