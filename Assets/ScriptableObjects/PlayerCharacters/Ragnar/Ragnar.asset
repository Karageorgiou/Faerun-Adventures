      encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.
  - featureTitle: Darkvision
    featureDescription: You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
      can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
      in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only
      shades of gray.

    featureDescription: You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer,
      and warhammer.
